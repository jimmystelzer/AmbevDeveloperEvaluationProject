# Proposed Improvements

This document describes the proposed improvements for the Ambev Developer Evaluation project, based on an analysis of the current code, architecture, and implementation standards.

## Tests

### Unit Tests
- **Increase unit test coverage**: Add unit tests for all services, handlers, and specifications.
- **Implement validator tests**: Ensure that all validators have complete unit tests.

### Functional Tests
- **Correct database access in functional tests**:
  - Properly implement the in-memory database for tests
  - Ensure adequate isolation between tests
  - Add appropriate configuration for data cleanup between test runs
- **Improve test fixtures**: Create more robust and reusable fixtures for different test scenarios.
- **Implement load tests**: Add tests to validate system behavior under load.

### Mocking External Services
- **Implement consistent mocks**: Create a standardized approach to mock external dependencies in tests.
- **Use dedicated test contexts**: Create specific test contexts for different test scenarios.

## Performance

### Caching
- **Implement caching strategy**:
  - Add caching for frequent queries such as sales listing
  - Configure appropriate cache expiration policy
  - Implement selective cache invalidation on write operations
  - Use Redis already configured in the project to store distributed cache

### Database Optimization
- **Create indexes for improved search**:
  - Add index on `Sales.CustomerId` to improve searches by customer
  - Add index on `Sales.BranchId` to improve searches by branch
  - Add index on `Sales.Date` to improve filters and sorting by date
  - Add index on `Sales.SaleNumber` for quick searches by number
  - Add index on `SaleItems.SaleId` to improve joins with the sales table
  - Implement composite indexes for common multiple filter scenarios

## Security

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Implement role-based access control**: Refine the authorization system to support granular permissions based on roles.
- **Add more robust JWT token validation**: Implement checks for expiration, issuer, and audience.

### Data Protection
- **Implement data masking in logs**: Ensure that sensitive data is not logged.
- **Add encryption for sensitive data**: Implement encryption for sensitive data stored in the database.

### API Security
- **Implement rate limiting**: Add rate limitation to prevent API abuse.
- **Improve input validation and sanitization**: Strengthen validation to prevent injection attacks.
- **Add security headers**: Configure HTTP security headers like CSP, HSTS, etc.

## Logs and Monitoring

### Log Improvement
- **Implement structured logging**: Adopt structured logging with Serilog to facilitate log analysis and querying.
- **Add correlationId**: Implement correlation ID in logs for request tracking.
- **Improve log granularity**: Adopt different log levels for different system components.
- **Implement contextual logging**: Log relevant context information in each log.
- **Add performance logging**: Record performance metrics to identify bottlenecks.

### Monitoring
- **Implement application metrics**: Add collection of metrics for monitoring performance and system health.
- **Configure alerts**: Implement alerts for critical system conditions.
- **Integrate with APM tools**: Consider integration with Application Performance Monitoring tools.

## Next Steps

To address these improvements, it is recommended to prioritize the following actions:

1. **High priority**:
   - Correct database access in functional tests
   - Implement caching strategy with Redis
   - Create indexes for query optimization
   - Improve observability

2. **Medium priority**:
   - Consolidate mapping profiles
   - Implement application monitoring
   - Increase unit test coverage
